## Introduction

To flourish in today's digital era, business managers must be aware of an agile business scenario, organisation, competitor strategy, ever-changing customer demands, and rapidly developing market cataclysms and opportunities. Analytics is the only way to grasp these insights while keeping up with the pace of the digital industry.
 
The widespread execution of new technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and intelligent automation will increase analytics adoption shortly. Despite analytics' indicated potential, traditional firms (think of all 20th-century sectors generating physical commodities) may be only scraping the surface.
While some businesses have built pockets of localised analytics procedures, relatively few have implanted analytics or considered it an unusual feature inside their organisation. Surprisingly, companies struggle with core analytics adoption concerns such as organisational structure, workforce challenges, and change surveillance.
 
Many businesses are rushing to get on board without thoroughly examining their business needs or competencies, which typically results in a poor return on investment from an analytics deployment. This section will cover several essential considerations for company executives to consider as they plan their analytics journey.
 
## Getting Familiar with Analytics Landscape

### Sponsorship and Strategy:

It is critical to have a long-term vision for analytics and back up with support. Sustained investment in technology, resources, and training is required to guarantee excitement and buy-in for analytics across the company. Before deciding on an analytics approach, several jigsaw pieces spanning business processes must be in sync with one another.

Considering the changing business environment and organisational objectives, a long-term data-driven strategy must be devised. While the technical overhaul and process of putting up data and IT systems to enable analytics may appear more daunting, the organisational shift in decision-making and adoption in day-to-day operations is frequently slower and more intense.

## Putting an Analytics Roadmap in Place

### Prioritising Activities: 

The majority of the eye-catching and spectacular use cases are only helpful when the analytics practice has progressed to a higher level of maturity. Analytics teams sometimes receive more project proposals than they can handle. The team's ability to punch through touted technologies (think Elon Musk's Neuralink or humanoid Sophia) is critical to the project's early success.
 
Instead of experimenting with "moonshots," the focus should be on tried-and-true value-delivery methods. Rather than claiming to be an "AI-driven firm," the choice to expand analytics capabilities should be based on moving toward a value-driven strategy. One such prioritising structure is shown in the diagram below.

## Conclusion

The capacity of an organisation to recognise business challenges, express them as analytics problems, and pick among available solutions spanning digitalisation, analytics, automation, and reporting is crucial to analytics success. 
A clear path from 'issue to outcome' is essential because it allows organisational analytics to concentrate on what it should â€“ directly supporting problem-solving, decision-making, and execution, improving company performance.
