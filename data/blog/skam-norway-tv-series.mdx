**SKAM** (translate to “Shame” in English) is a Norwegian teen tv series written and directed by Julie Adem. This tv series was first aired on 25 September 2015 at Norway’s public broadcaster NRK.

Despite no official promotion, the series was able to gain an exploded popularity online via word of mouth. Short clips got viral on Social media like Instagram, Tumblr, and Youtube after its first season. In addition, it was the most viewed show and broke all the streaming records in the history of NRK TV.

Skam got so many viewers internationally that NRK requested to add an English subtitle to the episode online. Unfortunately, the request declined due to the copyright issues of music presented throughout the series. And the exciting part is multi-lingual fans have made the English subtitle of the show, including all seasons and made the show available on online file-sharing platforms.

For 4 seasons and 43 episodes, the series makers focus on the daily life of a group of teenagers who studies at Hartvig Nissen School. Unlike other tv shows, where teenage actors are not teenagers, but in Skam, the makers made actual teenagers actors.
Skam tells these teenagers story well that viewers find themselves in these characters.

The main character of the series who consistently play a vital role in each season is Eva, Noora, Vilde, Sana, Jonas, Isak, William, Chris & Chris (lol, you will find some scenes where these two names will make you laugh). Along with these characters, every season introduced some new character and twisted story with new faces.

### Uniqueness of Skam

If you ask what makes Skam so popular and great, I will say how it represents everything from sexuality, love, religion, races, mental illness through their main characters.

One major thing that has changed teenagehood is the integration of technology and social media. Skam does it so well. Through the series, you will see the characters are on-screen texting, erasing, typing and searching on the web for something or obsess over what should be in the message, should they send it or not.

### Popularity around the world

Skam’s popularity was not confined only to Norway but also gained followers around the world. The series adapted in several other countries like France, Belgium, Germany, Italy, US, Spain, Netherlands. In every adaptation, it remains an accurate portrayal of drama, love, relationship, the friendship of teenage life. And perhaps that the reason Skam’s popularity shows no signs of slowing anytime soon.
