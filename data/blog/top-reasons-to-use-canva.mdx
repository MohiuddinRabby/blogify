As an entrepreneur with a brand, a content creator, a digital marketer or social media manager of a brand or company, you continuously need marketing material that includes

- Blog banner
- Social media post
- Posters
- Logo
- Business card
- Infographic
- Advertisement video
- And much more...

You can try doing these things by yourself using the most popular tools on the market like Adobe photoshop, illustrator or after-effects for motion video making. But using these tools need a steep learning curve and also time-consuming. And if you are not good enough at design, you need to go to a professional designer every time.

When your business enters the web-based media domain, you need the engagement of your targeted audience. Creating simple and boring graphics won’t make much effect on your business, that’s for sure. And surprisingly, **Canva gives a simple solution with a bunch of tastefully satisfying illustrations that will grow your social media profile as well as your brand business**.

**Canva** is a cloud-based design tool that helps to create images, design for print marketing. It’s a tool that has millions of high-resolution photo, graphics and designs. If you don’t have any prior knowledge of graphics design, don’t worry. Anyone can design their product with Canva even if they first design their product or any other design.

According to my opinion why Canva in best are these:

> #### Canva is Free

Yes, you heard right. And there is no trial period or no need for any payment card number to use free resources. The free version has more than 250,000 free templates, 100+ design types of social media posts, presentation. You can collaborate with team members and an additional 5GB of cloud storage. What you need more to get started as a free user! :D. And their pro pricing is so cheap. Only **$12.99/month** where the resource sky has no limit.

> #### Drag and Drop

As I previously said, you don’t need any prior knowledge of design to make graphics, banner, business card or advertisement video with Canva. Just drag your design and drop it to the place according to your preferences. That’s the most amazing feature for non-designer users to create world-class designs just with drag and drop.
