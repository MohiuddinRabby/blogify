One kilogram of cashew costs **$10(retail)**, seven times as much as peanuts. Price also varies from place to place, e.g. in the USA can cost **$15(retail)** per pound.

[In 2019 the world ate more than 830,000 metric tons of cashews](https://www.financialexpress.com/market/commodities/indian-cashew-crop-during-2020-21-will-be-shorter-by-approximately-50000-tonne/2000289). They are one of the most popular and valuable nuts globally, worth over $6 billion today.

Without absolute, accurate processing, these nuts wouldn’t be safe at all. Does this process make it so expensive? Let’s have a look.

Cashew grows select tropical climates around the world from the bottom hanging fruits like the picture below.

Tropical locations like India, Srilanka, Vietnam, ivory coast are the most suitable place to grow cashews. The trees are a member of the same family as poison ivy, and like poison ivy, cashew plants contain a toxin called urushiol. It’s found in the plant itself and the brown oil inside its nutshell. The poison can cause burns, itches, and blisters which why unprocessed cashews are considered dangerous to eat or touch. It’s also why they need more rigorous processing than other nuts.

Each fruit grows just one shelled nut, called a drup, which needs to separate by hand. The nuts must dry under the sun to help draw out some of the shell’s caustic liquid. The most difficult and dangerous step is splitting open the nut since toxic oil stills coat the drupes. Cashews are brittle, so factories manually do these steps to ensure machines wouldn’t break the nut. But doing this by hand has repeatedly raised issues within the industry. NGO’s have called out some factories for overdoing employees and putting workers at risk of burning themselves if they can’t manage to buy gloves for safekeeping. Today tools are advanced enough to crack the shells cleanly. Keeping the majority of nuts intact and helping minimize risk to workers.

After a machine splits open the shells, the next two crucial stages depend on workers, who have to do them by hand. The nuts are roasted to ensure, again, that the toxic liquid inside is destroyed.

The next stage is particularly tedious, as it entirely relies on handiwork. Workers must peel off the husk or the dry outer covering that surrounds each nut because it’s high in tannins and could irritate the throat. Experienced workers de-skin only about 2.5kg of cashews each night. This method is not only tough but also has an impact on price.

Cashews are graded by several features like colour, weight, and conditions. Large whole nuts are most valuable.

Because cashews can only be harvested once a year, some growers save a portion of the nuts in stock to continue making a profit in the rest months of the year.

But the stock comes at a steep cost. Just stocking the nuts can cost more than $65,000 each year. This reason causes prices to fluctuate a bit year-round. Because it also depends on each countries supply chain.

Likely, many of the cashews people buy in the US or Europe were grown in Africa, processed in Vietnam or India, and finally exported in the western market.

By hand or machine processing cashews nuts is not an easy task. And the world climate crisis could make it even harder. A 2013 report on the climate impact on cashews shows unseasonal rains and heavy dew can impact the quality of and the quantity of the nuts.

Amidst climate challenges, cashews continue to be popular. Healthy eating trends are key to driving demand, along with the versatility of the cashew itself, another reason the nut remains so valuable. Whether used as a snack, salad, cooking paste, or an alternative to milk or butter, cashews have many applications worldwide. Researchers found that the cashew market will grow to $7 billion by 2025. Increasing demand is likely to drive prices higher in the future.
