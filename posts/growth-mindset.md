Our mindset is essential when teaching ourselves new skills. Our perspective will have more of an impact on our chances of success than just about anything else.

Someone with the fixed mindset believes if they don’t get something on their first attempt, they never will. Also, consider that they aren’t smart enough to be able to do or understand some things.

However, a vast body of research shows that intelligence is not fixed but can be instead developed. Someone with a growth mindset believes they can get better at anything with effort and persistence.

What does this mean for us? It means we can learn new skills and develop new talents with persistence and grit.

There will be many times throughout any task or work that we will get stuck on a concept or a problem and may find ourselves questioning our ability to learn new things or the same position we often do.

When we find ourselves in this position, remind us that we may not get it yet but that with persistence and grit, we will. Struggling with something is growing. It doesn’t matter how long we work with a concept or project; all that matters is that we have the grit and determination to see it through. That’s how real learning happens.
