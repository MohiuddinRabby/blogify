**Distractions** take attention away from what an operator needs to do when performing a task. Distractions can be external (such as noise) or internal (such as tiredness, rumination, or anxiety).

Distractions may be caused by numerous circumstances, including the loss of interest in the primary activity, inability to pay attention due to various reasons, or the strength of the distractor.

#### Most common distractions and their solution

##### Digital Distractions

Digital distractions are email and notifications from different sites, such as social media. These distractions break your focus and make procrastination tempting. Therefore, should avoid them during study time.

**Solution** - Turn off notifications and add a blocker to your internet to limit your time on distracting sites.

##### Physical Distractions

Physical distractions are distractions from your environment, like a TV in the background or other people talking. These distractions can be just as damaging to your focus as digital distractions.

**Solution** - Find a quiet place to study where you can go to focus on your home. If that’s not an option, you can use noise-canceling headphones to block out noisy distractions in your environment.

##### Comparing Yourself to Others

People often compare themselves to others who are around them or have more experience than them. This is a recipe for depression and frustration.

**Solution** - Only compare yourself to your past self. Have your abilities and knowledge improved from where you were last week, last month, or last year? Be proud of the progress that you’ve made!
