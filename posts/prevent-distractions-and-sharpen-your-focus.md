**Distractions** take attention away from what an operator needs to do when performing a task. Distractions can be external (such as noise) or internal (such as tiredness, rumination, or anxiety).

Distractions may be caused by numerous circumstances, including the loss of interest in the primary activity, inability to pay attention due to various reasons, or the strength of the distractor.

#### Most common distractions and their solution

##### Procrastination

Procrastination is the action of preventing or delaying something. The word has origin from the Latin procrastinates, which itself emerged from the prefix pro-, indicating "forward," and castings, indicating "of tomorrow."

**Solution** - The Pomodoro Technique is a way of managing your time in order to stay focused. The idea is to set a timer for 25 minutes and to work on a task until the timer goes off. If you get distracted or interrupted during the 25 minutes, start the 25 minutes of work over again. Once you’ve successfully focused on work for 25 minutes, take a 5 minute break. When your break is over, repeat the 25 minutes of work and 5 minute break. After you’ve completed four 25 minute blocks of work, take a longer 15-30 minute break.

The Pomodoro technique is great for avoiding procrastination as it forces you to work without distractions. Since the work time only lasts 25 minutes before taking a break, it’s not overwhelming, making it harder to rationalize procrastination.

##### Digital Distractions

Digital distractions are email and notifications from different sites, such as social media. These distractions break your focus and make procrastination tempting. Therefore, should avoid them during study time.

**Solution** - Turn off notifications and add a blocker to your internet to limit your time on distracting sites.

##### Physical Distractions

Physical distractions are distractions from your environment, like a TV in the background or other people talking. These distractions can be just as damaging to your focus as digital distractions.

**Solution** - Find a quiet place to study where you can go to focus on your home. If that’s not an option, you can use noise-canceling headphones to block out noisy distractions in your environment.

##### Comparing Yourself to Others

People often compare themselves to others who are around them or have more experience than them. This is a recipe for depression and frustration.

**Solution** - Only compare yourself to your past self. Have your abilities and knowledge improved from where you were last week, last month, or last year? Be proud of the progress that you’ve made!
##### Not Taking Breaks

As you get into the material, you may feel compelled to study for long periods continuously. It might seem like you are getting more work done at first, but this often leads to burnout, resulting in lower productivity.

It may seem counterintuitive, but you will get more done if you regularly step back to recharge your mind and body. Researches show that production rises after breaks of all durations: from extended holidays down to microbreaks of 30 seconds. 

**John Trougakos, Associate Professor of Management at the University of Toronto, says that mental strength is similar to a muscle. Our focus becomes fatigued after sustained use and needs a rest period to recover, just like a bodybuilder resting between sets at the gym**.

**Solution** - Use the previously mentioned Pomodoro Technique to time how often and how long to take your well-deserved breaks. Feel free to play around and try with different rhythms and durations of leaves.
